			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>BlackBox is a bunch of young entrepreneurs driven by a common goal, i.e, to leave a mark in everything that we do, and to do everything with a difference.
We believe that everything around us has a little scope of improvisation, and that adds an interesting element to it.
BlackBox is not a conventional company, and we don’t intend to be one. We work on anything and everything that catches our fancy.
We consider it as our responsibility to give back to the society that has made us who we are. It would be our pleasure to serve the society and it’s people.</p>
